            employee there. While the company has worked in all different kinds of tech, PingPong+ is the product of an exploration towards a connected experience
            utilizing all different kinds of technologies like the Amazon echo, Apple TV, 
            Microsoft Kinect, and more. By hooking all of this tech together PingPong+ is able to elevate a typical game of ping pong to something more. Its Amazon Echo acts as a Convo UX hub for starting and stopping games. Its
            Apple TV displays scores and player names to an audience watching, its Microsoft Kinect tracks the ping pong ball and draws animations onto
            the table using a short throw projector, the Echo works as a central Convo UX hub to start games, and more. PingPong+ was showcased 
            at Solstice's FWD event and garnered attention from audience members and participants alike. Currently I am keeping the tech up to date and further exploring tis possiblities.

           Museum of Chicagoâ€™s China Hall displays a book of ink

           Qin Emperorâ€™s reign, but it is behind glass and limited
           in its interaction with visitors. We proposed a tangible
           extension to the exhibit using a leap motion controller and mock tools that allows visitors to simulate the
           act of ink rubbing to encourage visitors to better appreciate
           this valuable technique. With the use of an artificial tablet
           of ancient Chinese inscriptions and mock tools, visitors can
           perform the ink rubbing technique in steps, gradually
           revealing the translation of ancient Chinese characters, and
           then continue to engage in the process as a reproduction
           method by sharing their work with others. This prototype was created by a team of three students as part of Northwestern's TIDAL lab.
